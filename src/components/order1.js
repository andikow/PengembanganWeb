    <h2>Finding the Right Size </h2><br/>
    <h3>How does the size fit?</h3>
    <p>Size specifications of the individual manufacturers may vary. That’s why we always indicate whether a product runs smaller, larger or true to size. We collect information from our customers on how a product fits so that you can use this feedback to find the perfect fit.</p>
    <h3>Size chart</h3>
    <p>This size chart helps you to easily find the right size for yourself. Here’s a tip: spread out your favorite piece of clothing on the floor. Then use measuring tape to determine height (A), width (B) and length (C). Compare these measurements with our size chart to identify your size.</p>
    <h3>Size for US (women only)</h3>
    <p>Depending on the country, data for women's sizes may differ considerably from international sizes. Our table will help you compare sizes so you can easily find the right fit. Just select your country and compare your size with the corresponding international size.</p>
    <h3>Product description</h3>
    <p>You can find additional information about the fit or the cut – i.e. whether the garment is more form-fitting or loose – in the individual product descriptions on our website.</p>
